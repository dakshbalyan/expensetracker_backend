Build a web service to track the expenses, dues, and settlements for college-going students.
Requirements:
1. As a user, I should be able to record an expense with details such as
    a. why was the expense made
    b. where was it made
    c. when was it made
    d. how the expense is made.
    e. And any other details you feel are relevant from a user perspective
2. As a user, I should be able to record a due amount with details such as
    a. Whom do I owe the amount
    b. How much do I owe
    c. Date by when I need to pay the amount (repayment date)
    d. And any other details you feel are relevant from a user perspective.
3. As a user, I should be able to settle the dues by paying the amount. There can be different
algorithms to settle the due amounts.
    a. First in first out - the due added first will be paid first
    b. Latest repayment date first - the due that is nearest will be paid first
    c. Or there can be any other logic that can come at a later point in time.
